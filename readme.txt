Desription:
This Sprint two creates a database based on the github jobs api that I pulled data from. There are different subheadings for the table such as
job title, location, date posted and company name. I looped through the data and placed the data into a database.
I also did automated testing. I checked to see if a certain name or location is in the database and so on.

Instructions:
Run productionCode.py and a database file should be created.
