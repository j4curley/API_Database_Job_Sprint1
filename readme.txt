Desription:
This Sprint three creates a database based on the stack overflow jobs api that I pulled data from. I was a little confused about the file you sent us called "feed". But I used a  feedparser for that.I created a separate table for the stack overflow jobs. I had a couple of issues getting all the data into the database because with some jobs, there wasn't a corresponding location. I kept getting a key error. I also ran acouple of tests.

Instructions:
Run productionCode.py and a database file should be created.
