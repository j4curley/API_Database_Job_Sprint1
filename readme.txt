Desription:
This Sprint creates a database based on the stack overflow jobs api that I pulled data from. I then put the data into a SQLite 3 database. 
I used a  feedparser for that. I created a separate table for the stack overflow jobs. I also ran a couple of tests.

Instructions:
Run productionCode.py and a database file should be created.
