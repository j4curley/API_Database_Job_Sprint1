This Sprint one project pulls the data from the github jobs api and loads it into json object variables. Then I looped through the data and added it to a list and then wrote it to a file I made a couple of testing functions. One that checks to see if there are at least 100 items in the list. And the other function checks to see if there is a certain job title in the list.
